# Barony of Cynnabar Rails Application

This Rails application serves the web site for the Barony of Cynnabar at http://www.cynnabar.org.

Others may find it useful in creating a Rails application for organizations that:

 - want to create pages & delegate functionality to various users
 - have events stored in Google Calendars
 - have officers or program managers who need to edit their own pages
 - give awards or other recognition and want a way to track that (Order of Precedence functionality)

Some of this functionality may be extracted to Rails engines at a later date.

Notes:

 - Most of Devise's functionality for user management is currently disabled in
   this application; users can only be managed at the Rails console.
